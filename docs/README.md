## üí° Tips for Reading Documentation

1. **Start practical, go deep later:** Begin with API specs and examples, dive into architecture when you need to understand internals.

2. **Documentation hierarchy:**
   ```
   Examples (try it) ‚Üí API specs (syntax) ‚Üí Architecture (why it works)
   ```

3. **When docs are unclear:** Check working code in `/examples/` - code doesn't lie.

4. **For bugs/issues:** Always check root `/PROJECT_STATUS.md` first - your issue might be a known limitation.

5. **Contributing improvements:** Documentation PRs are welcome! Focus on:
   - Clarifying confusing sections
   - Adding examples
   - Fixing outdated information
   - Improving code snippets

## üìù Documentation Conventions

### Code Examples:
All code examples in documentation are **tested patterns** from actual working code unless marked with:
- `# Conceptual example - not tested`
- `# Future feature - not yet implemented`

### Version Specificity:
Documentation explicitly states version when features changed:
- "Since v0.1.8" = feature added/changed in that version
- "Current API" = v0.1.9 unless otherwise stated

### Parameter Defaults:
When docs show `weight=1.0`, this is the **actual default** in code, not an example value.

## ‚ùì Getting Help

**If you're stuck:**

1. **Check examples first:** `../examples/` - most questions answered there
2. **Search this directory:** `grep -r "your_topic" docs/`
3. **Read the architecture:** `Architectural overview.md` explains design decisions
4. **Check known issues:** Root `/PROJECT_STATUS.md` section "Known Bugs and Issues"
5. **Ask the maintainer:** (contact info in main README)

**Before filing an issue:**
- ‚úÖ Check if documented in `/PROJECT_STATUS.md`
- ‚úÖ Try the simplest possible reproduction case
- ‚úÖ Include version info (`import neurobridge; print(neurobridge.__version__)`)
